# Mission-to-Mars
This repository contains the app that scrapes the internet for Mars data, stores obtained data in the Mongo DB and shows the data on the app web-page using Flask and Bootstrap.

# Challenge
The https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/ site was down on Sunday, March 22, so the images of the Mars hemispheres are temporarily replaced by fake images. Web-scraping part of the Challenge will be added as soon as the source web-site is up.
